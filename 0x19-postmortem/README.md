ncident Report: Electricity Outage During Software Installation
<br>

## Incident Summary:
On 0x14. MySQL, an incident occurred during the installation of critical software (mysql) on my Linux servers due to a sudden electricity outage. This incident report outlines the details of the event, its impact, the immediate actions taken, root causes, and recommendations for preventing future occurrences.

## Incident Details:
Date and Time of Incident: 17/10/2023 - 20:00
Software Being Installed: MySQL
Incident Severity: [Low]
Incident Impact: The Installation Fail and the system was filled with broken files

## Timeline:
* 20:00 - Electricity cut off while I was installing the software by ssh connection with the server.
* 21:00 - Electricity is back on and I try to connect to the server by ssh connection.
* 21:10 - The Installation is failed and broken files still there.
* 21:20 - find way to remove broken files from the system.
* 21:30 - all broken files have deleted from the system and I can install the software again.
* 21:40 - the Softeare installed correctly and I can continue my work saftly.

## Immediate Actions Taken:
1. Upon detection of the electricity outage, the incident response team was immediately alerted.
2. The server was powered off safely to prevent potential data corruption.
3. The UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) logs were reviewed to understand the extent of the power outage.
4. Once power was restored, the server was rebooted, and a filesystem check (fsck) was initiated to ensure the integrity of the filesystem.

## Root Causes:
After a thorough investigation, the root causes of the incident were identified as follows:

1. Inadequate Power Backup: The server was not connected to a reliable UPS with a sufficient battery backup, and the electricity outage exceeded the server's uptime.

2. Lack of Proper Software Installation Procedure: The installation of the software lacked a proper rollback plan and did not consider the risk associated with unexpected interruptions.

Recommendations:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, we propose the following actions:

1. Improved Power Infrastructure:
   - Install a reliable UPS system with a sufficient battery backup to ensure uninterrupted server operation during short-term electricity outages.
   - Implement backup power solutions (e.g., generators) for longer outages.

2. Software Installation Procedure:
   - Develop and document a comprehensive software installation procedure that includes a well-defined rollback plan.
   - Test the installation process in a controlled environment to identify potential issues and develop contingency plans.

3. Monitoring and Alerts:
   - Implement monitoring and alerting systems to provide immediate notifications in case of power disruptions.
   - Regularly review and test these systems to ensure they are functioning as expected.

4. Regular Maintenance:
   - Schedule regular maintenance and inspections of power infrastructure to identify and address potential issues proactively.

## Conclusion:
The incident report provides an overview of the electricity outage incident during software installation on my Linux server. By implementing the recommended actions, we aim to enhance the reliability and resilience of my server infrastructure to mitigate the impact of similar incidents in the future.

This incident report is subject to review, and any additional findings or corrective actions will be documented accordingly.
